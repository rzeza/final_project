# final_project
Final project for computer programming

The purpose of the code is building a model that explains total fertility rate. The results of the code are data and variables formatting and econometric analyses of it. There are several model based on panel data and a model based on cross-sectional data.

The analyses is build in a such way, that the code (especially graphical and regressions part) could be used with difeerent sets of data and the changes would be needed only in few places (mostly by defining locals and globals).

All tables and charts created while running the code are available here.
I also share a video that explains, how the code works.
